One method that tends to work well for learning 3-style as a whole is to first look at a sheet (if you're just starting out, Jack Cai's sheet, or a slightly modified version is a great start) and go through each case one by one.

The pre-requisite for this is that you know and understand how commutators work.

For each case, first try and come up with a commutator (without looking at what the sheet has), then afterwards, look at what the sheet has and compare it with your own solution. Take what the sheet has into account and learn from it - apply it to the commutators you come up with in the future!
